### Linux system administrator -- April 2010 to December 2015
#### [Asian Development Bank](http://www.adb.org) (under RCG IT, Inc.), Pasig City

Developed and maintained automation tools to manage the Unix infrastructure for the Bank's mission-critical applications like ERP, data warehousing, financials, and business intelligence. The Asian Development Bank is a multilateral financial institution that provides technical and financial assistance to developing countries.

 * Provided platform-level support to the Bank's development and infrastructure operations teams.
 * Coordinated with various software development teams on continuous integration, rapid deployment, performance monitoring and tuning, and application support.
 * Developed and maintained tools for application deployment, monitoring, and performance tuning.
 * Documented testing and deployment scenarios for the Unix infrastructure requirements of the Bank.
 * Supported Unix servers that run Apache, Tomcat and WebSphere web servers, Oracle and MySQL database servers, Oracle ERP applications, and IBM business intelligence software.
 * Maintained an automation script that improves the deployment of Oracle applications. The deployment script, used within the Oracle web UI, was not actively maintained, and had numerous feature requests and issues submitted by the development teams. Upon assumption of code maintenance, feature requests and bugs were reduced to less than 10%.
 * Wrote an orchestration tool that provides self-service capabilities for tasks such as database and application server restarts, log retrieval, initiation of cold backups, among others. Commonly requested tasks from the development and operations previously went through the service request queues before being acted on by other teams. The use of the tool significantly decreased these requests, improving workflows across various teams.
 * Streamlined the provisioning process for Linux (physical and virtual) servers, which reduced build times from one day to less than an hour.

With the sync tool, jobs were centrally managed from a repository, and pulled by the corresponding servers, thus improving the scheduling workflow, and minimizing errors. This project was accepted in the [League of Professional System Administrators (LOPSA) Mentorship Program](https://lopsa.org/mentor).
 * Re-factored a service that routes SMS acknowledgements for Nagios alerts. The previous service was not capable of accepting alert acknowledgements through SMS. The new service resulted in shorter response times from different operations teams when acting on service alerts.
