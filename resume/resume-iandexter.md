## Professional Experience


### Linux  system administrator -- April 2010 to present
#### [Asian Development Bank](http://www.adb.org), Pasig City (under RCG IT, Inc.)

Maintains AIX, SuSE and Red Hat enterprise Linux servers in the Bank's data center for its mission-critical applications like ERP, data warehousing, financials, and business intelligence. The Asian Development Bank is a multilateral financial institution that provides technical and financial assistance to developing countries.

* Provides platform-level support to the Bank's development and infrastructure operations teams.
* Coordinates with various software development teams for continuous integration, rapid deployment, performance monitoring and tuning, and application support.
* Develops and maintain tools for application deployment, monitoring, and performance tuning.
* Documents testing and deployment scenarios for the Unix infrastructure requirements of the Bank.
* Supports Unix servers that run Apache, Tomcat and WebSphere web servers, Oracle and MySQL database servers, Oracle ERP applications, and IBM business intelligence software.
* Maintains an automation script for deploying Oracle applications that streamlines the development process. The deployment script, used within the Oracle web UI, was not actively maintained, and with numerous feature requests and issues submitted by the development teams. Upon assumption of code maintenance, the feature requests and bugs have been reduced to less than 10%.
* Wrote an orchestration tool that provides "self-service" capabilities for tasks such as database and application server restarts, log retrieval, initiation of cold backups, among others. Commonly requested tasks had to go through the service request queues before being acted on. The tool significantly decreased these requests from development and operations teams, improving their own workflows.
* Streamlined the provisioning process for Linux (physical and virtual) servers, which reduced build times from one day to less than hour.
* Automated the security baseline configuration for Linux servers as part of compliance requirements for the Bank. Quarterly security audits tended to be time-consuming exercises for administrators. The automation process helped decrease the number of audit findings and interventions by more than 60%.
* Created and deployed a management tool for setting scheduled jobs from a centralized repository. Scheduled jobs were previously stored and managed locally. With the sync tool, jobs were centrally managed from a source code repository, and pulled by the corresponding servers, thus improving the scheduling workflow and minimizing errors. This project was accepted in the [League of Professional System Administrators (LOPSA) Mentorship Program](https://lopsa.org/mentor).
* Re-factored a service that routes SMS acknowledgements for Nagios alerts. The previous service was not capable of accepting alert acknowledgements through SMS. The new service resulted in higher response times from different operations teams when acting on service alerts.
* Writes and maintains various scripts in Perl, Python and Bash for automating system administration, performance monitoring, and tuning tasks.
* As subject-matter expert, provides quality control and source code review for automation tools and scripts used in the Unix infrastructure.
* Current project: a simple RESTful API for retrieving objects from a configuration management tool. The API will be used to expose server configuration items in a dashboard tool.
